<a>INFO</a>
====
hi! my name is jack and i really like garm3nhud ql and wanted to improve it.<br>
here is a version of garm3nhud ql that is more towards the way i like huds to be, using fixes that hypnotize has put into some of their other updated huds.<br>
i hope to at some point do enough improvements to this hud to release it as my own hud and/or put these improvements into garm3nhud ql's repository.<br>
the changes would most likely not be put into the garm3nhud ql repository as they are changes that alter how the hud looks normally.<br>
if the changes were to be put into the garm3nhud ql repository, they would be added as customizations rather than being forced on the user.<br>
most of the work here is from garm3n and hypnotize, so they are credited first before myself.<br>
major changes include full linux support as well as a customizable font, but other more minor things have been added that you can see below.<br>

<a>KNOWN BUGS</a>
====
- elements are oddly positioned on resolutions like 1920x1080 and 1366x768
- all of demoman's meters have no labels
- when you die your health has a chance to stay overhealed or hurt
- alternate ammo position is broken when using higher clip sizes (for example the snipers SMG)
- enabling then disabling streamer mode breaks many things
- killstreak notification has extra space on the right
- loadout button overlaps with spectator health
- overtime label sometimes breaks (still trying to find out why)
- winpanel icons show up twice sometimes
- payload race elements overlap with damageaccount
