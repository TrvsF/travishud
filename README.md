hi! my name is jack and i really like garm3nhud ql and wanted to improve it.<br>
here is a version of garm3nhud ql that is more towards the way i like huds to be, using fixes that hypnotize has put into some of their other updated huds.<br>
i hope to at some point do enough improvements to this hud to release it as my own hud and/or put these improvements into garm3nhud ql's repository.<br>
most of the work here is from garm3n and hypnotize, so they are credited first before myself.<br>
